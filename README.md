CSCI 3660 Individual Exam 2: Gardening Journal

# Project Description:
This mobile app utilizes React, Expo, Expo Router, and SQLite to demonstrate interations between user (client), app (server--local), and SQLite databasing, compiling into an easily palatable and intuitively designed application that handles all of one's gardening needs. Data within the database persists across user sessions and can only be mutated during them. There is no user authentication, as this app was built with the assumption that the 'journal' is personalized to a single user's activity, meaning that there are no unique users
